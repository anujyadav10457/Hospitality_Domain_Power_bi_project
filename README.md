# Hotel Revenue Management Dashboard

## Overview
Welcome to the Hotel Revenue Management Dashboard project! This Power BI project is designed specifically for Revenue Managers to track and analyze key performance metrics across hotels in India. The dashboard provides insights into revenue, occupancy, Average Daily Rate (ADR), Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), and Realisation. Managers can filter data based on city, room type, month, and week, and compare week-to-week performance.

## Features
Revenue Tracking: Monitor total revenue and breakdowns by city and room type.
Occupancy Analysis: View occupancy rates and trends across different time periods and locations.
ADR and RevPAR: Analyze Average Daily Rate and Revenue Per Available Room to understand pricing and revenue performance.
Realisation: Track how much revenue is being realized compared to projections.
Filtering Options: Easily filter data by city, room type, month, and week to get specific insights.
Week-to-Week Comparison: Compare key metrics week over week to identify growth or decline.
Interactive Line Charts: Click on metrics to view detailed line charts showing week number vs. performance metrics.

## Filtering Data
Use the filtering options on the right side of the dashboard to drill down into specific data:

**City-wise:** Select a city to view metrics for that specific location.
**Room Type:** Filter by different types of rooms (e.g., Standard, Deluxe, Suite).
**Month-wise:** Choose a specific month to analyze.
**Week-wise:** Narrow down data to specific weeks for detailed analysis.
Week-to-Week Comparison
The dashboard provides week-to-week comparison charts for all key metrics:

**Growth/Decline Indicators**: Visual indicators show whether there is growth or decline in metrics compared to the previous week.
**Line Charts:** Click on any metric to view a line chart displaying week number vs. the selected metric (e.g., Revenue, Occupancy, ADR).
Data Visualizations
**Revenue Trends:** Bar charts and line charts showcasing revenue trends over time and across different filters.
**Occupancy Rates:** Graphs depicting occupancy rates with the ability to filter by different dimensions.
ADR and RevPAR Analysis: Visual breakdown of Average Daily Rate and Revenue Per Available Room.
**Realisation:** Tables and charts showing realized revenue compared to projections.
